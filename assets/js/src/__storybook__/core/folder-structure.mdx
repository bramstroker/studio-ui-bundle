# Folder-Structure

## Folder Structure

### Overview

- `src/assets/js/src/core`
  - `__storybook__`: Contains storybook files with no direct connection to the code.
  - `app`: Contains essential files that are needed to use and start the application.
  - `components`: Contains purely presentational components by following the [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).
  - `lib`: Contains classes and functions dedicated to complex abstactions.
  - `modules`: Contains the primary business logic of the different features.
  - `utils`: Contains reusable functions and hooks that can be used in different parts of the application.

### File & Folder names

File and Folder names should always be written in kebab-case.

The folder structure overall should follow a logical approach that aligns well with the current implementation details.

### Common filenames

Filenames should identify what they contain.

A few examples:

`asset-container` ← Suffix `-container` identifies a React container component  
`asset-view` ← Suffix `-view` identifies a React presentational component  
`asset-slice` ← Suffix `-slice` identifies a Redux store slice  
`asset-api-slice` ← Suffix `-api-slice` identifies a API part based on RTK Query  
`asset-view.styles.ts` ← Suffix `.styles` identifies a emotion css file based on antd-style  
`asset-provider` ← Suffix `-provider` identifies a React context provider  
`use-asset` ← Prefix `use-` identifies a React custom hook
